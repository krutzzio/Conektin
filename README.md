Project that I made to conclude the Bootcamp in IP de Fundaci√≥ Esplai.

The project consist in a social page where you can find and create families to connect with peopla that have the same hobbies and interest as you, also you can find events to meet in real life those who share your pastimes.

Right now this project is not deployed but you can clone it to use it. Remember to execute npm i for the modules, and use the api.
